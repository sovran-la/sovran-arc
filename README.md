# Arc Helper Types

This library provides convenient wrapper types that combine `Arc` and `Mutex` for safe shared mutable access across threads, drawing inspiration from Swift's reference counting and memory management patterns.

## Types

### Arcm<T> - Arc-Mutex Wrapper
A thread-safe wrapper combining `Arc` and `Mutex` for shared mutable access to a value:
```rust
let counter = Arcm::new(0);
counter.modify(|n| *n += 1);
assert_eq!(counter.value(), 1);
```

Key features:
- Thread-safe shared mutable access
- Clean API for modifications and value access
- Automatic cloning of the internal value
- Default implementation for types implementing `Default`
- Implements `Debug`, `Clone`, and `From`

### WeakArcm<T> - Weak Reference Companion
A weak reference version of `Arcm` that doesn't prevent deallocation:
```rust
let strong = Arcm::new(42);
let weak = strong.downgrade();

// Access if still alive
if let Some(value) = weak.value() {
    println!("Value still exists: {}", value);
}
```

### Arcmo<T> - Optional Arc-Mutex Wrapper
Similar to `Arcm` but wraps an `Option<T>`, providing nullable semantics:
```rust
let value = Arcmo::some(42);
assert_eq!(value.value(), Some(42));

value.take();  // Remove the value
assert!(value.is_none());

value.replace(100);  // Set a new value
assert_eq!(value.value(), Some(100));
```

Key features:
- All the benefits of `Arcm`
- Optional value semantics
- Methods like `take()` and `replace()`
- `is_some()` and `is_none()` checks
- Default implementation creates an empty (None) instance

### WeakArcmo<T> - Optional Weak Reference
Weak reference version of `Arcmo`:
```rust
let strong = Arcmo::some(42);
let weak = strong.downgrade();

assert!(weak.is_some());
assert_eq!(weak.value(), Some(42));
```

## Swift-like Characteristics

This library brings several Swift-like memory management features to Rust:

1. **Reference Counting**: Like Swift's `strong` and `weak` references, these types provide explicit reference counting with strong (`Arcm`/`Arcmo`) and weak (`WeakArcm`/`WeakArcmo`) variants.

2. **Safe Shared Mutability**: Similar to Swift's class instances, these types allow safe shared mutable access across multiple references.

3. **Optional Value Semantics**: `Arcmo` provides similar semantics to Swift's optional references, allowing for nullable shared references.

4. **Clean API**: The API design focuses on ergonomics and safety, similar to Swift's emphasis on safe and expressive APIs.

## Thread Safety

All types in this library are thread-safe and can be safely shared across threads:

- Internal mutability is handled through `Mutex`
- Reference counting is atomic through `Arc`
- Safe to clone and share across thread boundaries
- Deadlock protection through scoped locks

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```rust
// Create a shared counter
let counter = Arcm::new(0);

// Clone and share across threads
let counter2 = counter.clone();
std::thread::spawn(move || {
    counter2.modify(|n| *n += 1);
});

// Modify in main thread
counter.modify(|n| *n += 1);
```

### Optional Values
```rust
// Create an optional shared value
let value = Arcmo::some("Hello");

// Share with another thread
let value2 = value.clone();
std::thread::spawn(move || {
    if value2.is_some() {
        value2.modify(|s| *s = "World");
    }
});

// Take the value if it exists
if let Some(v) = value.take() {
    println!("Taken value: {}", v);
}
```

### Weak References
```rust
let strong = Arcm::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);
let weak = strong.downgrade();

// Modify through weak reference
weak.modify(|v| v.push(4));

// Check if value still exists
if let Some(vec) = weak.value() {
    println!("Vector: {:?}", vec);
}
```

## Requirements

- Rust 1.56 or later
- Types must implement `Clone`
- Optional: `Debug` for debug formatting
- Optional: `Default` for default implementation
